**Objective:** Today, we explored key concepts in product design, focusing on understanding product value, creating user personas, and mapping user journeys. Additionally, we learned about AI prompt engineering to optimize interactions with AI models for more accurate and efficient responses.

**Reflective:** informative

**Interpretive:** The session emphasized the importance of user-centered design in creating products that resonate with customers. Developing user personas and mapping user journeys provided insights into the thought process behind designing meaningful user experiences. The AI prompt engineering session also clarified how to structure inputs for improved AI interactions.

**Decision:** I plan to apply user-centered design principles in future projects and experiment with AI prompt engineering to refine the accuracy and relevance of AI responses in various use cases.
